# :arrow_right: R36S Minimalist controls theme (640x480)

:white_circle: The theme was created for the R36S with **_AmberELEC /Pan4ELEC_** systems. I designed them in inkscape to be very minimalist based on the console controls.

There are 8 color options to choose from and they apply to the system wallpaper.
